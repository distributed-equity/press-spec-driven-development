# Preface {.unnumbered}

Something fundamental is changing in how we build software, and it's moving fast.

AI coding tools have gone from curiosity to daily driver in the space of a couple of years. Most of us are still figuring out what works. We prompt, we iterate, we get something that mostly functions, and we move on. The industry has started calling it "vibe coding" — half joke, half admission that we don't have a proper methodology yet.

Specification Driven Development is an attempt to change that. The core idea is simple: instead of prompting and fixing, you write specifications. Instead of maintaining code, you maintain the specs that generate it. The specification becomes the artifact. Code becomes a side effect.

I'm writing this book now — early, incomplete, in the open — because this methodology is emerging in real time and I want to capture it while the lessons are fresh. SDD isn't mine to gatekeep. The ideas in this book draw on work happening across the industry, from Thoughtworks to Microsoft to individual practitioners who are discovering the same patterns independently. The sooner we have a shared language and a shared set of practices, the sooner we all benefit.

My hope is that this book becomes a catalyst. A starting point for collaboration, not the final word. The repository is public. The specs are visible. The methodology is documented in the same repo that uses it. If you disagree with something, open an issue. If you've found a better pattern, contribute it. If you've hit a wall that SDD doesn't address, that's exactly the kind of problem I want to hear about.

These technologies are transformative. How we adapt to them matters — not just for individual productivity, but for the engineering community as a whole. I want us to handle this transition well. I want the practices we develop now to be ones we're proud of in five years.

I also just find the subject fascinating. I want to be in the thick of it with my sleeves rolled up, building things, breaking things, and writing down what I learn. If that sounds like your kind of project, you're welcome here.
