# Author's Note {.unnumbered}

You are reading an early beta. Chapters are incomplete, some exist only as outlines, and the content changes with every commit. Treat this as a living document, not a finished book.

This book is written using the methodology it describes.

I am building this in the open because specification-driven development improves through practice and shared experience. I want to hear from you — especially if you have:

- Case studies or real-world lessons from working with AI coding agents
- Experience practising specification-driven development on your own projects
- Technical feedback on the book's content, structure, or accuracy

Contributing to this book works the same way as contributing to any open-source project. The repository is on GitHub at [github.com/DevOpsKev/spec-driven-development](https://github.com/DevOpsKev/spec-driven-development). You can open issues, submit pull requests, or reach me directly:

- Email: [kevin@kevinryan.io](mailto:kevin@kevinryan.io)
- Website: [kevinryan.io](https://kevinryan.io)

Anyone who contributes direct effort to this book will be credited as a contributor.
