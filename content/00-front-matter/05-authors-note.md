# Author's Note {.unnumbered}

Fair warning: you're reading an early beta. Chapters are incomplete, some exist only as outlines, and the content changes with every commit. If something reads like it was written at midnight with too much coffee — it probably was. Raise a ticket and let me know. Treat this as a living document, not a finished book.

This book is written using the methodology it describes. The specifications, the toolchain, the CI/CD pipeline, the provenance tracking — all of it lives in the same repository as the prose. Every chapter is generated from a spec. When something doesn't work, I fix the spec, not the output. The book is its own case study, iteration is part of the process.

I'm building this in the open because specification-driven development gets better through practice and shared experience. The methodology is still young and I don't have all the answers. Nobody does yet. That's exactly why I want to hear from you — especially if you've got:

- Case studies or war stories from working with AI coding agents in the real world
- Experience practising specification-driven development on your own projects, even rough early attempts
- Technical feedback on the book's content, structure, or accuracy — including the parts you think are wrong

Contributing works the same way as any open-source project. The repository is on [GitHub](https://github.com/DevOpsKev/spec-driven-development). Open an issue, submit a pull request, or just reach out directly:

- Email: [kevin@kevinryan.io](mailto:kevin@kevinryan.io)
- Website: [kevinryan.io](https://kevinryan.io)

Anyone who contributes direct effort to this book gets credited as a contributor. Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow — and that includes the specs.
