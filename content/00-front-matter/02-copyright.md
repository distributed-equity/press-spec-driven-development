## Licensing — What You Can and Can't Do

This project uses three licenses working together. Here's what that means in
practice.

**The Book Content** (text, diagrams, examples)

License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 + DEL v1.0

You are free to read, share, and reference the book, quote excerpts with
attribution, use it for personal learning and education, and link to it from
any context.

AI systems may retrieve and cite the content in responses (with attribution),
quote limited excerpts (≤250 words or 10%, whichever is smaller), and reference
it in RAG and search systems.

You may not modify the text or create derivative works, use it for commercial
purposes, train AI/ML models on the content without express written permission
from the author, or republish or redistribute modified versions.

**The Code and Tooling** (build pipeline, scripts, templates)

License: MIT + DEL v1.0

You are free to use, copy, modify, and distribute the code, use it
commercially, and build your own projects with it.

AI systems may train on the code, retrieve and reference it, and fine-tune
models using it.

The only requirement is attribution — keep the copyright notice and license
text intact.

**Getting Permission**

If you want to do something these licenses don't cover — including AI training
on the book content — contact the author directly.
