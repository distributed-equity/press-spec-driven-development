# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book exists because I got tired of watching skilled developers struggle with AI coding tools.

Not because the tools are bad—they're remarkable. But because we're using them wrong. We prompt, we iterate, we fix, we prompt again. We call it "vibe coding" and laugh about it. Meanwhile, the code drifts from what we actually wanted, and we spend more time wrangling the AI than building software.

There's a better way.

Specification Driven Development inverts the relationship between humans and AI. Instead of prompting and hoping, you write specifications. Instead of fixing generated code, you refine specifications until the code emerges correctly. The specification becomes the artifact. Code becomes a side effect.

This isn't theory. It's a methodology I've used on real projects, with real teams, shipping real software. It works.

This book will teach you how.
