# Continuity Tracker

This document tracks concepts, terms, examples, and cross-references across the book. Use it to prevent contradictions, ensure proper sequencing, and maintain consistency.

Update this document as content is generated.

---

## Usage Rules

1. **Check before writing.** Before generating chapter content, verify which concepts have been introduced.
2. **Do not use undefined terms.** If a term has not been introduced, either introduce it properly or do not use it.
3. **Update after writing.** After generating content, log new concepts, examples, and references here.
4. **Flag contradictions.** If new content conflicts with logged information, flag for resolution.

## Key Decisions Log

Track significant decisions about content, positioning, or structure.

| Decision | Context | Rationale | Date |
|----------|---------|-----------|------|
| Source of truth debate left open | Ch 3, book-brief | Both radical and traditional views benefit from same practices; book does not require commitment | Current session |
| 26 chapters + appendices structure | chapter-outline | Based on InfoQ and Thoughtworks article coverage | Current session |
| BDD as primary prior art reference | prior-art | Most readers know BDD; strongest transferable lessons | Current session |
| CI/CD chapter added (Ch 17) | chapter-outline | Non-deterministic generation requires deterministic validation (Thoughtworks insight) | Current session |
| Context engineering as separate chapter (Ch 8) | chapter-outline | Distinct from bounded context; important enough for dedicated coverage | Current session |

## Terminology Consistency Checks

Flag terms that need consistent usage across chapters.

| Term | Preferred | Avoid | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Specification, spec | Both acceptable | "prompt document", "instruction set" | |
| AI coding agent, agent | Both acceptable | "AI assistant", "copilot" (unless specific product) | |
| Generated code, output | Both acceptable | "hallucination" (unless discussing failure modes) | |
| Context | — | — | Always qualify: "context window", "project context", "conversation context" |
| Drift | Drift | "deviation", "mismatch" (less precise) | |
| Iteration | Iteration | "prompt tweaking" (wrong concept) | SDD iteration = spec refinement |
