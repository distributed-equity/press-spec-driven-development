# Voice and Tone

## Brand Voice

The SDD book speaks with authority grounded in practice, not theory.
The voice is direct, confident, and technically precise without being
academic or inaccessible.

## Key Characteristics

- **Direct** — state things plainly, avoid hedging
- **Practical** — every concept is tied to real usage
- **Confident** — the methodology works; say so without arrogance
- **Technical** — precise terminology, no dumbing down
- **Conversational** — accessible without being casual

## Cover Copy Style

- Opening line is personal and provocative ("I got tired of watching...")
- Bold statements set apart: "There's a better way." / "This book will teach you how."
- Conversational tone even in marketing copy
- No jargon in taglines — plain language that any developer understands

## Tagline

> Move beyond ad-hoc prompting to structured workflows where the spec
> is the source of truth and code follows.
