# Specification Driven Development: The Book

A practical guide to Specification Driven Development (SDD) for professional developers working with AI coding agents.

## What is this?

This repository contains the specifications, content, and build pipeline for a book about Specification Driven Development—a methodology where specifications become the primary artifact and code becomes a generated side effect.

The book is being written using SDD. The specifications in this repo drive the content generation.

## Core Thesis

> The specification is the artifact. Code is a side effect.
