## prompt notes

| Document | Purpose | What It Contains |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| chapter-outline.md | Structure | Chapter/section list with one-line descriptions. The map of the book. |
| chapter-briefs/ | Per-chapter scope | One file per chapter defining: goals, key concepts introduced, required examples, dependencies on prior chapters. |
| glossary.md | Terminology canon | Authoritative definitions for all SDD terms. Single source of truth—agent references this, never invents definitions. |
| examples-library.md | Reusable examples | Curated specifications, code snippets, scenarios the agent can draw from. Keeps examples consistent across chapters. |
| anti-patterns.md | What to avoid | Catalog of common SDD mistakes with explanations. Gives agent concrete failure modes to discuss. |
| author-voice.md | Your perspective | Your opinions, experiences, anecdotes, strong takes. Raw material only you can provide—agent weaves it in. |
| prior-art.md | Positioning context | Brief notes on related concepts (TDD, BDD, domain-driven design, prompt engineering) and how SDD relates/differs. |
| continuity-tracker.md | Cross-reference state | Running log of: concepts introduced (and where), examples used, forward/backward references. Prevents contradictions. |
