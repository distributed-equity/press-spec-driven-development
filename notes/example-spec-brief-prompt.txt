git pull origin main && Load get_skill("author-spec") and use it to
expand the following brief into a full spec. Save the spec to
.specmcp/specs/devops/readme-update.md

Brief:
- README.md is a generated artifact, re-executable from this spec
  whenever the repo state changes
- Each execution overwrites README.md and creates a new provenance record
- README should carry a generation notice (spec name, "do not hand-edit,
  update the spec instead")
- Agent must discover current repo state at execution time, not rely on
  hardcoded lists
- Use MCP tools (list_specs, list_skills, list_brand), cat .mcp.json,
  and directory scanning to populate content
- Document the SDD workflow (two loops, eight steps) as a prominent
  section
- Document all MCP servers and their tools (discovered from .mcp.json
  and servers)
- Document all skills (discovered from list_skills)
- Document the provenance system
- Update repository structure tree from actual directory state
- Strengthen the dogfooding angle — this repo proves the methodology
- Replace static Progress section with something that doesn't rot (or
  remove)
- Keep sections that are structurally stable (thesis, audience, outputs,
  build, CI/CD, license)
- British English throughout
- Reference AGENTS.md not CLAUDE.md for agent workflow
